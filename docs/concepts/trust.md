Trust is a cornerstone of agility - that is, to be trusting _and_ trustworthy. Trust goes beyond merely being honest with each other - it involves being reliable, collaborative, truthful, generous, gracious, non-judgemental, accepting and more.

Imagine the best team of people you have ever worked alongside or enjoyed the company of. With that team mind, do/did you trust them with your livelihood?

In High performing teams, each member of the team has an influence on the livelihood of the other members of the team. Why, because their efforts are as important as your efforts to outcomes of the entire cohort. If the team performs inadequately, it becomes inevitable that changes will come in the form of layoffs for underperformers and/or the injection of new members in an effort to increase team effectiveness. So it can be said that a teammate has some influence over the livelihoods of another teammate. For that reason alone, we could make the argument that it is imperative to have people who trust each other in each team.
