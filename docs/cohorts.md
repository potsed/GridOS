Cohorts are the functionally similar members of an organisation in that they have similar interests. Cohorts should have regular days of coming together to learn.

Now it's very important to know, these days of coming together are not Communities of Practice, nor are they chapters, instead these are organised educational days. They are conference like events or external conferences.
