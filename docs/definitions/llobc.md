{{ page.project }} Logical Levels of Business Change is a model for making significant organisational structural changes. Unlike [Prosci ADKAR](https://www.prosci.com/methodology/adkar) or similar change facilitation models, which you can use with {{ page.project }}, this model highlights which organisation layer should be targeted for change.

Each layer of this model would have a higher ROI. For example, simply changing a process without updating skills will cause problems, however if one updates the skills first then it is more likely to have an effect on the process.
