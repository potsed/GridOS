GridOS is only in it's conception phase, there is still much work to do. Contributions are welcome.

{{ page.project }} takes a different approach to agility, unlike other so called frameworks which prescribe specific and dare we say rigid ways of working - we recognize that every organisation is unique and has individualized requirements.

Creating a bespoke agile environment should not be any more challenging than employing an unsafe, one size fits all framework. We believe that agility should be characteristic of the entire business not a set of methods attached to the business or worse, in small pockets of the business.

In other words, {{ page.project }} will not fish for you but will teach you how to fish for yourselves. It is designed to encourage innovation and growth within the unique constraints of your organisation.

{{ page.project }} is therefore a framework for creating bespoke agile ways of working unique to your own organisational requirements. We will not tell you how your business should operate, or give you a checklist of methodologies to deploy. We will give you a process to unlock agility across your organisation because agility is, in our view, a leadership challenge not a process challenge although process change is also required as a result.
