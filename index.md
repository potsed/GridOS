## {{ page.project }} {{ page.title }}

{: .warning }
GridOS is in it's infancy and not ready for use, there is still much work to do. Contributions are welcome.

> {{ page.project }} is an Organisational Agility Framework which has roots in agile frameworks, but which focusses in on Mindset first as the leading edge of adoption.

{{ page.project }} takes a different approach to organisational agility, we recognize that every business is unique and has individualized requirements. So this framework focusses on changing mindsets and unlocking the cognitive potential of the organisation alongside which are the practical changes required to support such a mindset.

This is an opinionated framework which diverges from so called "conventional wisdom" which, in our opinion, has become outdated and no longer suitable for progress into the future. It therefore requires courage, dedication and persistance from leaders. Ultimately it requires a complete organisational restructuring but taking a pragmatic approach to do so. {{ page.project }} is likely to be quite different to the to existing models which are commonly practiced.

{{ page.project }} provide you with change plans, structural plans, exercises and everything you need to develop [agility as an organisational characteristic](/GridOS/concepts/agile_as_character) rather than just a set of mechanical processes.

Creating a bespoke agile environment should not be any more challenging than employing a one size fits all framework. We believe that agility should be characteristic of the entire business not a set of methods attached to the business or worse, in small pockets of the business.

In other words, {{ page.project }} will not fish for you but will teach you how to fish for yourselves. It is designed to encourage innovation and growth within the unique constraints of your organisation.

{{ page.project }} is therefore a framework for creating bespoke agile ways of working unique to your own organisational requirements. We will not tell you how your business should operate, or give you a checklist of methodologies to deploy. We will give you a process to unlock agility across your organisation because agility is, in our view, a leadership challenge not a process challenge although process change is also required as a result.
