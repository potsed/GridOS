## {{ page.project }} {{ page.title }}

{{ page.project }} takes a different approach to organisational agility, we recognize that every business is unique and has individualized requirements. So this framework is focussed on changing mindsets and unlocking the thought and innovation potential of an organisation. We do prescribe specific changes to the organisation - which is likely to be quite different to the ways many are used to. Unlike the unsafe and useless, but very popular, prescriptive frameworks available - we provide you with change plans, structural plans, everything you need to create [agility as part of the organisational character](/GridOS/concepts/agile_as_character) rather than just a set of mechanical processes.

{: .warning }
GridOS is only in it's conception, there is still much work to do. Contributions are welcome.

Creating a bespoke agile environment should not be any more challenging than employing an unsafe, one size fits all framework. We believe that agility should be characteristic of the entire business not a set of methods attached to the business or worse, in small pockets of the business.

In other words, {{ page.project }} will not fish for you but will teach you how to fish for yourselves. It is designed to encourage innovation and growth within the unique constraints of your organisation.

{{ page.project }} is therefore a framework for creating bespoke agile ways of working unique to your own organisational requirements. We will not tell you how your business should operate, or give you a checklist of methodologies to deploy. We will give you a process to unlock agility across your organisation because agility is, in our view, a leadership challenge not a process challenge although process change is also required as a result.
